# Slacker
Ping your inactive friends on slack

Why? Why not!

The application requires a config.json file in the same folder where the slacker executable is located.

Example config-file:

```json
{
	"Token" : "<your_token>",
	"UserName" : "Slacker",
	"Channel" : "<channel_id>",
	"UserToPing" : "joakimthun",
	"IntervalInSeconds" : 60
}

```
