# Slacker
Ping your inactive friends on slack

Why? Why not!

The application requires a config.json file in the same folder where the slacker executable is located.

Example file:

''
{
	"Token" : "<your_token>",
	"UserName" : "Slacker",
	"Channel" : "<channel_id>",
	"UserToPing" : "joakimthun"
}

''
